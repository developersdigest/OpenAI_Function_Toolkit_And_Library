# OpenAI Function Calling Toolkit and Function Library

Welcome to the **OpenAI Function Calling Toolkit**, an open-source library developed by @developersdigest. This toolkit provides a collection of AI functions for natural language processing tasks, designed to be used with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model.

## Video Tutorial

To help you get started with the OpenAI Function Calling Toolkit, I have created a  video tutorial on the @developersdigest YouTube channel. This tutorial covers the usage and capabilities of the toolkit, providing step-by-step guidance.

## Overview

The **OpenAI Function Calling Toolkit** empowers developers to easily integrate AI functions into their applications. These functions cover a wide range of tasks, such as taking screenshots, scraping HTML, interacting with APIs, and more. By leveraging the power of AI, developers can automate complex tasks, enhance chatbot interactions, and create intelligent applications.

## Function Library

The **OpenAI Function Library** is a collection of pre-defined AI functions that are included in the toolkit. These functions are ready to use and provide specific functionalities to simplify your development process. Some of the initial available functions are with many more to come over the coming weeks:

- `takeScreenshot`: Capture screenshots of websites.
- `scrapeHTML`: Extract the HTML content of web pages.
- `exampleFunction`: A template function that demonstrates how to create custom functions.

Please refer to the function documentation for detailed information on each function's usage and parameters.

## Contributing

I strongly contributions to expand the library with more useful functions. If you have ideas for new AI functions or improvements to existing ones, please consider contributing. You can contribute by opening issues to report bugs or suggest new features, as well as submitting pull requests to add new functions or enhance the existing ones.
